# Project 1 - Book Review Back End

## Project Description
For this project I decided to create the backend code for a book review web service. 

## Technologies Used
- 

## Getting Started
1. 

## Usage
1. Once code has been downloaded, use a tool of your choice to run the code. It can also be run through a command line tool using "mvn spring-boot:run".
2. Once the application is running, you can use one of the following to access the data in the database: web browser page linking to port 9000 ("localhost:9000" where a URL would go), an application such as Postman, forwarding requests to localhost:9000, or from the command prompt / terminal using "curl localhost:9000".
3. Use the various mappings to view, update, delete stored data.
